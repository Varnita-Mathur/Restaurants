1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I spent around half of a day coding this. I would improve the aesthetics of the site and add more flexible search filters.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.The most useful feature, thought not new, is the state function in react.
It creates a dynamic, user oriented experience.

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
I would check CPU/memory, site traffic and poor load distribution.

4. How would you improve the API that you just used?

I would embed a googlemaps link from the latitude and longitude provided so users can see how far the restaurant is from them.

5. Please describe yourself using JSON.
